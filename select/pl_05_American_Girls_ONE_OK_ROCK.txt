I know how to treat a lady
Who knows how to treat her man
I've been in love one or two times
I made out the best that I can
I've been all around the world and back
And here's what I have to say
The ladies I love and livin' in the U.S.A
[Chorus]
I'm talking about American girls
They got what I need
American girls
That's what I want
American girls
There ain't no better boy and that's no lie
She takes you home to meet her daddy
He looks you right in the eye
He says, now tell me you intention, boy
And you make your reply
I'm a man of honor, my thoughts are pure
And you can bet your life
I won't even kiss her,
Unless I'm gonna make her my wife
[Chorus]
