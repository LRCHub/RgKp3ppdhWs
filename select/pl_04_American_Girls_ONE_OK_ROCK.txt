She comes out on
Fridays every time
And stands out in a line
I could've been
anyone she'd seen
She waits another week
to fall apart
she couldnt make another day
I wish it was anyone but me
I could've been anyone you see
She had something breakable
just under her skin
American girls all
weather and noise
Playing the changes
for all of the boys
Holding a candle up to my hand
Making it feel so incredible
She comes out of closets
every night
But then she locks herself away
Where she could keep
everything from me
I could've been anyone you see
She's nothing but porcelain
underneath her skin
American girls are
weather and noise
Playing the changes
for all of the boys
Holding a candle
right up to my hand
Making me feel so incredible
Little shiver shaking
me everyday
But I could get
this same thing anywhere
So if she goes away
well, it's alright and I'm ok
She said come back again tonight
and I said I might
I might I might
She said well that's alright
If it's alright
it's alright with you
and it's alright
if it's alright with me
I waited for an hour last
Friday night
she never came around
She took almost
everything from me
I'm goin' through my closets
tryin' on her clothes
almost everyday
I could've been anyone you see
I wish it was anyone but me
There's nothin but pills
and ashes under my skin
American girls are
weather and noise
Playing the changes
for all of the boys
Holding a candle
right up to my hand
Making me feel so incredible
If I made you cry
please tell me why
I'll try again if you let me try
American girls are
feathers and cream
Come into bed so edible
American girls
oh American girls
American girls, oh oh oh oh
American girls
oh American girls
American girls, oh oh oh oh
You made me cry
You made me cry
You made me cry
Yeah, you made me cry
You made me cry
Hey miss American girl
Oh, oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh yeah
